They are responsible for maintaining BloomNetwork.earth and supporting a culture of peer-to-peer collaboration and knowledge sharing. At the outset of Bloom, they also anchor the global working groups on marketing, grants, community, and tech who facilitate staff and volunteer sharing across the Local Bloom hubs. For example, the marketing team helps promote Local Blooms' activities to attract more public support, and the grants team researches financial opportunities to support the impact areas different Blooms are working in. At the outset, Bloom International also manages the multisig that distributes FLO (Flowers) and Grants for the Local Action Rewards program.
